__**1.1 What is the difference between Harem Heroes and Hentai Heroes?**__
```
Harem Heroes is the original game which runs on the Nutaku platform. Hentai Heroes is the same game, but runs of different platforms. All of these platforms have a separate playerbase that cannot interact with one another. The differences are as follows:
-In Harem Heroes, Koban values are divided by 6 both in costs and rewards
-In Hentai Heroes, players can collect or buy new avatars for their profile.  Harem Heroes does not have this feature and has a limited avatar selection.
-The platforms have different payment processors.
-Some collaboration-type events, offers and rewards may be exclusive to one platform only.
