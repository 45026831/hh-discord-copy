__**2.5 When do I promote or demote in Leagues?**__
```xl
The top 15 players will promote to the next tier, unless they are already in the highest tier (Dicktator III). The bottom 15 players and everyone with 0 points will demote to the previous tier, unless they are already in the lowest tier (Wanker I).
Example, in a league size of 100, place 86-100 or have zero points to demote.```
