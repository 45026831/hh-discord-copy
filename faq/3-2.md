__**3.2 Which Pachinko should I play to get girls?**__
```- A single Epic Pachinko pull has a ~6-7% chance to grant you a girl.
- An Epic Pachinko 10 pull guarantees you exactly one girl, no more and no less.
- An Epic Pachinko Draft pull guarantees you exactly one girl, giving you a choice between 2. No items.
- An Event Pachinko pull has a 22.5% chance to grant you a girl. No more or less.
- Four "6 games" Mythic Pachinko pulls are preferable over a single "1 game" Mythic Pachinko pull, which has a 1-2% chance of winning a 100% of a girl.

Which one you prefer is up to you, it depends entirely on whether or not you want to take the gamble.```
