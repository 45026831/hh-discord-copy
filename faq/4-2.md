__**4.2 What is the drop rate for girls' :shard: Attraction?**__
Shard drop rates can vary by event or villain tier, but has a range of ~5% to 10% per battle. There’s also a small chance with each drop to get 100 shards (Mythic Days girls are exempted, as you can only drop 1 shard at a time).  Currently, 1-Star Common girls have a chance of joining your harem immediately (100 shards) when dropped after battles with Dark Lord.  For all other rarities, the ranges of shards you can win when dropped are as follows:
