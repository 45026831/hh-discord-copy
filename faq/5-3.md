__**5.3 The mobile app isn’t working, what do I do?**__
```The app is known to be unstable and the recommendation is to not use it at all. Approach the game via a mobile browser instead, it has the exact same functionalities.

Adding a shortcut to the game to your phone’s homescreen will allow you to play it fullscreen on both HH.com and Nutaku. If you are on Nutaku, click on the "On iOS? Play here." link to reach the proper mobile page, this is a misleading description.
If you insist, try force closing the app then re-opening it again.```
