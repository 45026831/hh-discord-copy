__**6.2 What Are The Benefits of Being in a Club?**__
```There are currently two main benefits to joining a club: club bonuses and club champions.

Club Bonuses are given to all members of the club and remain active as long as they are members of that club.  Each club has 8 categories of bonuses that can be upgraded through club member donations of ymens and kobans:  
-Member Cap increases the club membership cap
-HardCore/Charm/Know-How/Endurance/Harmony all boost the player stats of each said type.
-Experience/Money Gain increases XP and ymen gains respectively.

Club Champions are club-exclusive challenges that involve the efforts of every club member to impress a sex champion and win the affection of special champion girls.```
